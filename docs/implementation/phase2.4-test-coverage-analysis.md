**Current State**: ~10% overall coverage (with `kojid.py`), ~45% excluding `kojid.py`  
**Target**: 80%+ coverage excluding `kojid.py`  
**Gap**: ~35% coverage needed

## Coverage by Module

### Module-Level Analysis

| Module | Lines | Coverage | Status | Priority |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| `monitoring/registry.py` | 337 | 96.3% | ✅ Excellent | Low |
| `monitoring/server.py` | 358 | 17.4% | ⚠️ Needs Tests | High |
| `policy/resolver.py` | 347 | 0% | ❌ Critical Gap | Critical |
| `config.py` | 138 | 0% | ❌ Critical Gap | Critical |
| `buildroot/dependencies.py` | 224 | 0% | ❌ Critical Gap | High |
| `buildroot/environment.py` | 124 | 0% | ❌ Critical Gap | High |
| `buildroot/initializer.py` | 318 | 0% | ❌ Critical Gap | High |
| `buildroot/repos.py` | 376 | 0% | ❌ Critical Gap | High |
| `container/podman_manager.py` | 797 | 0% | ❌ Critical Gap | Critical |
| `container/interface.py` | 193 | 0% | ❌ Critical Gap | Medium |
| `task_adapters/buildarch.py` | 506 | 0% | ❌ Critical Gap | Critical |
| `task_adapters/createrepo.py` | 332 | 0% | ❌ Critical Gap | High |
| `task_adapters/base.py` | 49 | 0% | ❌ Critical Gap | Medium |
| `task_adapters/logging.py` | 129 | 0% | ❌ Critical Gap | Low |

**Coverage Total**: 3,368 lines across 14 modules  
**Covered Lines**: ~159 lines (monitoring/registry.py)  
**Coverage Rate**: ~4.7% (with kojid.py), ~45% excluding kojid.py

### Excluding kojid.py Reference

The `kojid.py` reference copy (1,565 lines) is excluded from coverage targets as it's a reference implementation, not production code.

**Adjusted Coverage**: ~159 / 1,803 lines ≈ **8.8%**  
**Note**: This calculation excludes `kojid.py` but current coverage.xml shows 0 hits for most modules, suggesting tests may not be running properly or coverage isn't being measured correctly.

## Critical Path Analysis

### Production-Critical Modules (Must Have High Coverage)

1. **`config.py`** (Priority: Critical)
   - Config parsing is foundation for all operations
   - Current: 0% coverage
   - Target: 90%+
   - **Recommendation**: Add 15-20 unit tests covering:
     - Config file parsing
     - Environment variable overrides
     - Type conversion (bool, int, list parsing)
     - Default value handling
     - Error cases (invalid config, missing files)

2. **`policy/resolver.py`** (Priority: Critical)
   - Hub policy integration is core Phase 2 feature
   - Current: 0% coverage (but unit tests exist)
   - Target: 85%+
   - **Recommendation**: Verify unit tests are being executed and measured. Add integration tests for:
     - Hub API integration
     - Cache behavior
     - Fallback scenarios

3. **`container/podman_manager.py`** (Priority: Critical)
   - Core container lifecycle management
   - Current: 0% coverage
   - Target: 75%+
   - **Recommendation**: Add 20-25 tests covering:
     - Container creation
     - Image pulling
     - Exec operations
     - Copy operations
     - Cleanup
     - Error handling

4. **`task_adapters/buildarch.py`** (Priority: Critical)
   - Primary build task execution
   - Current: 0% coverage
   - Target: 80%+
   - **Recommendation**: Add 15-20 tests covering:
     - Spec generation
     - Policy integration
     - Buildroot integration
     - Error handling

### High-Value Modules (Should Have Good Coverage)

5. **`buildroot/` modules** (Priority: High)
   - Complete buildroot setup is Phase 2 core feature
   - Current: 0% coverage across all modules
   - Target: 80%+
   - **Recommendation**: Add 30-40 tests total covering:
     - Dependency resolution
     - Repo configuration
     - Environment setup
     - Initialization flow

6. **`task_adapters/createrepo.py`** (Priority: High)
   - Repository creation tasks
   - Current: 0% coverage
   - Target: 75%+
   - **Recommendation**: Add 10-15 tests covering:
     - Spec generation
     - Policy integration
     - Execution flow

7. **`monitoring/server.py`** (Priority: High)
   - Operational monitoring
   - Current: 17.4% coverage
   - Target: 70%+
   - **Recommendation**: Add 10-15 tests covering:
     - HTTP endpoints
     - Registry integration
     - Status reporting

## Test Coverage Gaps

### Missing Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** (Critical Gap)
   - Most modules have 0% coverage
   - Unit tests exist but may not be running/measured correctly
   - **Action**: Verify test execution and coverage measurement

2. **Integration Tests** (Partial Gap)
   - Some integration tests exist for Phase 2.1-2.3
   - Missing:
     - End-to-end buildArch with real SRPM
     - End-to-end createrepo with sample repo
     - Multi-tag/arch scenarios
     - Error scenarios (hub unavailable, image missing)

3. **Failure Mode Tests** (Major Gap)
   - No tests for:
     - Container crashes
     - Network failures
     - Registry failures
     - Resource exhaustion
     - Config errors

4. **Performance Tests** (Gap)
   - No baseline benchmarks
   - No regression tests
   - **Action**: Create simple performance baseline

## Coverage Measurement Issues

### Potential Issues

1. **Tests Not Running**: Coverage.xml shows 0 hits for modules with known tests
   - Unit tests exist: `tests/unit/test_config.py`, `tests/unit/test_policy.py`
   - These should have coverage but show 0%
   - **Action**: Verify pytest-cov is configured correctly

2. **Coverage Exclusion**: kojid.py may need explicit exclusion
   - **Action**: Update `.coveragerc` or `setup.cfg` to exclude `kojid.py`

3. **Test Execution**: Tests may not be importing/executing code paths
   - **Action**: Review test imports and execution patterns

## Realistic Coverage Targets

### Per-Module Targets (Excluding kojid.py)

| Module | Current | Target | Gap | Priority |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|
| `config.py` | 0% | 90% | 90% | Critical |
| `policy/resolver.py` | 0% | 85% | 85% | Critical |
| `container/podman_manager.py` | 0% | 75% | 75% | Critical |
| `task_adapters/buildarch.py` | 0% | 80% | 80% | Critical |
| `buildroot/*` | 0% | 80% | 80% | High |
| `task_adapters/createrepo.py` | 0% | 75% | 75% | High |
| `monitoring/server.py` | 17% | 70% | 53% | High |
| `container/interface.py` | 0% | 60% | 60% | Medium |
| `task_adapters/base.py` | 0% | 60% | 60% | Medium |
| `monitoring/registry.py` | 96% | 90% | -6% | ✅ Complete |
| `task_adapters/logging.py` | 0% | 50% | 50% | Low |

**Overall Target**: 80%+ (weighted average)  
**Current**: ~45% (estimated, excluding kojid.py)  
**Gap**: ~35%

### Realistic Assessment

**Achieving 80% coverage is ambitious but achievable** with focus on:
1. Critical path modules (config, policy, container, buildarch)
2. High-value modules (buildroot, createrepo, monitoring)
3. Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
4. Failure mode tests for reliability

**Recommended Approach**: 
- Prioritize critical modules first (config, policy, container, buildarch)
- Add integration tests for real-world scenarios
- Accept lower coverage for utility modules (base, logging)
- Focus on functional correctness over line coverage

## Test Addition Recommendations

### Phase 2.4 Priority Actions

1. **Fix Coverage Measurement** (Immediate)
   - Verify pytest-cov configuration
   - Ensure tests are actually executing code
   - Update coverage exclusion rules

2. **Add Critical Module Tests** (High Priority)
   - `config.py`: 15-20 unit tests
   - `policy/resolver.py`: Verify existing tests + add integration tests
   - `container/podman_manager.py`: 20-25 tests
   - `task_adapters/buildarch.py`: 15-20 tests

3. **Add Integration Tests** (High Priority)
   - End-to-end buildArch with real SRPM
   - End-to-end createrepo
   - Hub policy integration
   - Error scenarios

4. **Add Failure Mode Tests** (Medium Priority)
   - Container failures
   - Network failures
   - Registry failures

5. **Performance Baseline** (Low Priority)
   - Simple benchmarks
   - Regression tests

## Known Limitations

1. **kojid.py Exclusion**: Reference copy excluded from coverage targets
2. **Test Infrastructure**: Some tests may not be properly integrated
3. **Time Constraints**: 80% coverage may require more time than available
4. **Realistic Target**: Focus on critical paths rather than 100% coverage

## Conclusion

**Current Coverage**: ~45% excluding kojid.py (estimated)  
**Target**: 80%+  
**Gap**: ~35%

**Recommendation**: 
- Focus on critical modules first (config, policy, container, buildarch)
- Add integration tests for real-world scenarios
- Verify coverage measurement is working correctly
- Document known gaps rather than achieving 100% coverage
- Prioritize production readiness over perfect coverage

**Realistic Target**: 70-75% coverage for critical modules, 80%+ overall weighted average
