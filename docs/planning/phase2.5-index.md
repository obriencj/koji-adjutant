## Key Takeaways

### The Gap
- SRPM task adapters (`buildSRPMFromSCM`, `rebuildSRPM`) not implemented
- Discovered 2025-10-31 during user review
- Blocks production deployment and integration testing

### The Impact
- Cannot run complete build workflows (SCM → SRPM → RPM)
- Cannot deploy to production or staging
- +2-3 weeks to deployment timeline

### The Plan
- **Phase 2.5**: Implement SRPM adapters (2-3 weeks)
- Comprehensive design complete
- Detailed roadmap ready
- Low technical risk (proven approach)

### The Ask
- Approve Phase 2.5 implementation
- Allocate Implementation Lead (15-18 days)
- Accept +3 week timeline adjustment
