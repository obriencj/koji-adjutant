# Koji-Adjutant Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-31
**Current Phase**: Phase 2.5 Week 1 Complete (SRPM Adapters - In Progress)
**Status**: Production-Ready for BuildArch Tasks Only (Phase 2.5 Week 1: RebuildSRPM Complete)
**Strategic Planner**: Overall coordination and planning

---

## Executive Summary

Koji-Adjutant successfully replaces mock-based build execution with podman containers while maintaining full koji hub compatibility. The project has completed Phase 1 (foundation) and Phase 2 (production readiness), delivering a functional container-based build worker with hub policy integration, complete buildroot setup, operational monitoring, and comprehensive testing.

**Key Achievement**: 85% test pass rate, < 5% performance overhead, backward compatible with koji hub, production-ready architecture.

**Critical Gap Identified (2025-10-31)**: SRPM task adapters (`buildSRPMFromSCM`, `rebuildSRPM`) are not implemented. Current implementation can only execute buildArch tasks with pre-built SRPMs. Complete build workflow (SCM → SRPM → RPM) requires SRPM adapter implementation. See "Known Limitations" section for details.

## SRPM Adapter Gap Analysis (Added 2025-10-31)

### Background

During project review, it was discovered that SRPM task adapters were not implemented in Phase 1 or Phase 2. This creates a critical gap in functionality: the current implementation can only execute `buildArch` tasks with pre-built SRPM files, but cannot create SRPMs from source control or rebuild existing SRPMs.

### Impact on Build Workflow

**Complete Koji Build Process**:
```
User: koji build f39 git://example.com/package.git

1. BuildTask (parent coordinator) ← kojid.py (implemented)
   ↓
2. buildSRPMFromSCM subtask ← ADAPTER MISSING ❌
   - Checkout source from git/svn
   - Run rpmbuild -bs or make srpm
   - Upload SRPM to hub
   - Returns: mypackage-1.0-1.src.rpm
   ↓
3. buildArch subtasks (parallel) ← ADAPTER IMPLEMENTED ✅
   - x86_64: rpmbuild --rebuild mypackage-1.0-1.src.rpm
   - aarch64: rpmbuild --rebuild mypackage-1.0-1.src.rpm
   - Returns: mypackage-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm, etc.
```

**Current State**: Step 2 is missing, so Step 3 cannot be reached in normal operation.

### Required Adapters

#### 1. BuildSRPMFromSCMAdapter (High Priority)

**Original kojid location**: `BuildSRPMFromSCMTask` (line 5410-5570 in kojid.py)

**Requirements**:
- SCM integration: git, svn, cvs checkout
- Network access: DNS resolution, HTTPS/SSH protocols
- Build execution: `make srpm` or `rpmbuild -bs`
- Install group: `srpm-build` (not `build`)
- Spec file validation
- SRPM upload to hub

**Complexity**: HIGH (network, SCM protocols, multiple build methods)

#### 2. RebuildSRPMAdapter (Medium Priority)

**Original kojid location**: `RebuildSRPM` (line 5326-5410 in kojid.py)

**Requirements**:
- SRPM unpack: `rpm -iv <srpm>`
- Macro application: correct dist tags, release
- Build execution: `rpmbuild --rebuild`
- Install group: `srpm-build`
- SRPM validation
- SRPM upload to hub

**Complexity**: MEDIUM (no SCM, simpler workflow)

### Architectural Considerations

#### Container Requirements
- **Network Policy**: SCM checkout requires network access (different from RPM builds)
- **Install Groups**: `srpm-build` vs `build` have different package sets
- **Volume Mounts**: Same as buildArch (workdir, koji storage)
- **Image Selection**: Same policy-driven approach as buildArch

#### Implementation Pattern
Follow existing adapter pattern:
```python
class BuildSRPMFromSCMAdapter(BaseTaskAdapter):
    def build_spec(self, ctx, task_params, session, event_id) -> ContainerSpec:
        # Similar to BuildArchAdapter but:
        # - Enable network
        # - Use srpm-build install group
        # - Different command execution

    def format_result(self, container_id, task_params) -> dict:
        # Return: {'srpm': 'work/12345/mypackage.src.rpm', ...}
```

#### Testing Requirements
- SCM checkout from git (public repos for testing)
- SRPM build and validation
- Integration with BuildTask coordinator
- End-to-end workflow test (SCM → SRPM → RPM)

### Estimated Implementation Effort

**Total**: 2-3 weeks (1 engineer)

| Task | Effort | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| SRPM adapter design document | 2 days | High |
| RebuildSRPMAdapter implementation | 3 days | High |
| RebuildSRPMAdapter tests | 2 days | High |
| BuildSRPMFromSCMAdapter implementation | 5 days | Critical |
| BuildSRPMFromSCMAdapter tests | 3 days | Critical |
| SCM integration testing | 2 days | High |
| End-to-end workflow validation | 2 days | Critical |
| Documentation | 1 day | Medium |

**Total**: 20 days (~3 weeks)

```

### Key Patterns

1. **Protocol-Based Abstractions**: `ContainerManager` protocol isolates podman specifics
2. **Adapter Pattern**: Task adapters translate koji tasks to container specs
3. **Policy-Driven**: Hub controls image selection via policies
4. **Exec Pattern**: Step-by-step execution for debugging and clarity
5. **Registry Pattern**: Monitoring tracks active containers/tasks
6. **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation when components unavailable

---

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+ (type hints, f-strings, pathlib)
- **Container Runtime**: Podman 4.0+ (via podman-py)
- **Koji Integration**: koji library (XMLRPC, config parsing)
- **Testing**: pytest, tox, pytest-cov

## Success Assessment

### Phase 2 Goals: Achievement Status

| Goal | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Hub policy integration | ✅ Complete | PolicyResolver implemented, tested |
| Real configuration | ✅ Complete | kojid.conf parsing working |
| Complete buildroot | ✅ Complete | BuildrootInitializer functional |
| Performance parity | ✅ Exceeded | < 5% overhead (target was < 20%) |
| Production testing | ⚠️ Partial | 85% pass rate, gaps documented |
| Operational readiness | ✅ Complete | Monitoring server functional |
| **Complete task coverage** | ❌ **Incomplete** | **SRPM adapters missing (discovered 2025-10-31)** |

**Overall Phase 2 Success**: ⚠️ **71% Complete** (SRPM adapters required before deployment)

### Production Deployment Assessment

**Ready For**:
- ✅ Development testing with pre-built SRPMs
- ✅ BuildArch task validation
- ✅ Createrepo task validation
- ⚠️ Limited testing (buildArch-only workflows)

**Not Ready For** (BLOCKED):
- ❌ **Production deployment** - Missing SRPM adapters (CRITICAL)
- ❌ **Staging environment deployment** - Cannot run complete builds
- ❌ **Integration testing with koji-boxed** - Requires full build workflow
- ❌ **Real package builds** - Cannot build from source control
- ❌ **Operator evaluation** - Incomplete build system

**Additional Gaps**:
- ⚠️ High-volume production (needs stress testing)
- ⚠️ Critical builds (needs more validation)
- ⚠️ Multi-worker deployments (needs coordination testing)

**Recommendation**: **BLOCK deployment until Phase 2.5 complete**. Implement SRPM adapters (2-3 weeks), then proceed to staging deployment and integration testing.

## Recommendations

### CRITICAL: Before Any Deployment

**DO NOT PROCEED TO DEPLOYMENT** until SRPM adapters are implemented:

1. **Implement SRPM Adapters** (2-3 weeks) - BLOCKING REQUIREMENT
   - Design document for SRPM adapter architecture
   - RebuildSRPMAdapter implementation and tests
   - BuildSRPMFromSCMAdapter implementation and tests
   - End-to-end workflow validation (SCM → SRPM → RPM)

### For Production Deployment (After Phase 2.5)

1. **Start with Staging**: Deploy to non-critical build environment
2. **Build Container Images**: Create production buildroot images per ADR 0004
3. **Enable Monitoring**: Use HTTP API for operational visibility
4. **Configure Hub Policy**: Set up tag-based image policies
5. **Monitor Performance**: Track overhead and optimize if needed
6. **Gather Feedback**: Collect operator experience

### For Phase 3 (Future)

1. **Testing**: Achieve 80%+ coverage, fix remaining test failures
2. **Documentation**: Complete operator guides
3. **Integration**: Full koji-boxed validation
4. **Features**: Network policies, container caching
5. **Performance**: Tuning based on production data
6. **Scaling**: Multi-worker coordination and testing

---

## Success Criteria: Final Assessment

**Phase 2 Success Criteria** (from roadmap):

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Hub policy integration | ✅ Complete | PolicyResolver working |
| Real configuration | ✅ Complete | kojid.conf parsing functional |
| Complete buildroot | ✅ Complete | Dependencies, repos, environment |
| Performance < 20% | ✅ Exceeded | Measured < 5% overhead |
| Test coverage 80%+ | ⚠️ Partial | 45% overall, higher on critical paths |
| Operational readiness | ✅ Complete | Monitoring server functional |
| **SRPM task support** | ❌ **MISSING** | **Critical gap discovered 2025-10-31** |

**Overall**: ✅ **5/7 criteria met** (71% success rate)

**Critical Finding**: SRPM task adapters were not part of original Phase 2 criteria but are **essential** for production deployment. This represents a significant scope gap that must be addressed before deployment.

---

## Conclusion

Koji-Adjutant has successfully completed Phase 2 with excellent architecture and performance, but a **critical gap has been identified** (2025-10-31): SRPM task adapters are not implemented, blocking production deployment and integration testing.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clean architecture with good separation of concerns
- Excellent performance (< 5% overhead)
- Comprehensive documentation (30+ documents)
- Successful multi-personality coordination
- Production-ready monitoring and configuration
- BuildArch and Createrepo adapters working well

**Critical Gaps**:
- ❌ **SRPM task adapters missing** (buildSRPMFromSCM, rebuildSRPM)
- ❌ **Cannot run complete build workflows** (SCM → SRPM → RPM)
- ❌ **Blocks all deployment and integration testing**

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Test coverage (45% vs 80% goal)
- Some test failures (15%)
- Operator documentation gaps
- Real-world validation needed
- SCM integration not implemented

**Strategic Assessment**: ⚠️ **Project is viable but NOT ready for deployment**. Must complete Phase 2.5 (SRPM adapters) before staging deployment or integration testing.

**Revised Timeline**:
1. **Phase 2.5**: SRPM Adapters (2-3 weeks) ← **CRITICAL PATH**
2. **Then**: Staging deployment and integration testing
3. **Then**: Phase 3 Production Hardening

---

**Phase 2: COMPLETE** ✅ (with critical gap identified)
**Next: Phase 2.5 - SRPM Task Adapters** ← **BLOCKER FOR DEPLOYMENT** 🚨
